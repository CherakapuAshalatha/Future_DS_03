# 🎓 College Event Feedback Analysis — Internship Task 3  
**By Future Interns | Data Science & Analytics Project**

## 📝 Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing student feedback collected after college events such as tech fests, workshops, and seminars. The objective is to transform this data into meaningful insights using data preprocessing, sentiment analysis (NLP), and visualizations. It demonstrates how feedback can be leveraged to enhance student satisfaction and event quality.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Clean and prepare feedback data collected via Google Forms.
- Analyze numerical ratings for various course or event-related aspects.
- Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze written comments.
- Visualize key trends using charts and word clouds.
- Identify areas of success and opportunities for improvement.

## 🔍 Key Features  

- **📊 Average Ratings Visualization**  
  A horizontal bar chart showing average ratings for various aspects like clarity, presentation, support, and assignments.

- **🥧 Course Recommendation Chart**  
  A pie chart illustrating the percentage of students who recommended the course (rating ≥ 7), versus those who did not.

- **🧠 Sentiment Analysis Using TextBlob**  
  Automatically classifies student feedback into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiment based on polarity scores.

- **☁️ Word Cloud from Feedback Comments**  
  A visual representation of the most frequently used words in feedback, revealing common praise or concerns.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Google Colab** — Cloud-based Python environment  
- **pandas** — Data manipulation and transformation  
- **matplotlib & seaborn** — Data visualization  
- **TextBlob** — Sentiment analysis (NLP)  
- **wordcloud** — Word frequency visualization

## 🧠 What I Learned  
- How to clean and structure survey data using pandas.  
- Applied lambda functions to create new features such as sentiment and recommendation flags.  
- Gained hands-on NLP experience by analyzing sentiment with TextBlob.  
- Developed visualizations to tell clear data-driven stories.  
- Learned to extract insights from feedback that can guide future decisions.

## 💡 Key Insights & Suggested Improvements  

- **Top-Rated Aspects**  
  Students gave the highest scores for instructors who were *well-versed in the subject* and *responsive to doubts*.

- **Areas for Improvement**  
  Aspects such as *assignment difficulty* and *course structuring* had lower ratings, suggesting a need for clearer expectations or better pacing.

- **Sentiment Overview**  
  A majority of the feedback was **positive**, but a significant number of **negative and neutral** responses indicate that there are still student concerns to address.

- **Recommendation Summary**  
  Approximately **70%** of students would recommend the course, while **30%** gave lower ratings — indicating the need to improve perceived value and engagement.

- **Suggestions**:
  - Use more real-life examples in lectures.  
  - Reduce workload or give clearer assignment instructions.  
  - Consider mid-event surveys to collect ongoing feedback.  
  - Include more hands-on/practical sessions for better engagement.
